# 🌿 Planty

Planty is a cross-platform project built with Flutter that aims to simplify your plant irrigation routine through a beautiful, intuitive, and smart app that connects with your PlantyPot — an automated irrigation system designed to take care of your plants so you don’t have to.

## The Project

This project was born during a glass of wine 🍷 with my friend Andrea, who was building an autonomous irrigation system.
While he was working on the hardware — sensors, water tank, lighting — a question came up:

> *“What would be a user-friendly way to manage all this?”*

That’s when the idea of Planty was born: a cross-platform, easy-to-use mobile application to control and monitor the entire irrigation system effortlessly.

## The Collaboration

Andrea is in charge of the hardware: sensors, valves, lighting, and everything that makes water flow where it should.

Igor (that’s me 👋) is developing the software: the backend, sensor communication, and the Flutter app that brings it all together.

## The Vision

Maybe one day, we’ll have a complete, market-ready product —

## Tech Stack

- Flutter – cross-platform app development  
- Supabase – backend & database  
- IoT Hardware – custom sensors & microcontrollers  
- Provider – state management  

## Work in Progress

- Manage all your vases (each representing a valve in the system)  
- Monitor humidity, lighting, and irrigation history  
- Trigger manual watering or let automation do the job  
- Sleek UI with carousel and grid views  
- Cross-platform support for Android, iOS, and Web
